This is the tutorial on lambdas, method reference, and functional interfaces. 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Java is an OOP language, so it always works with classes and **doesn't support stanalone functions**. In case you want to **pass some function as a method parameter**, or **store some code into a variable**, you should use a *Funatinal Interface* and a *Lambda expression*. 

* A *Functional Interface* represents a **function signature**. It contains only one abstract method.
* A *Lambda expressoin* respresents a **function body**. Is an anonymous function that implements the abstract method of the functiona interface

The purpose of the lambda and functional interfaces is to **make it easier to create function objects** and provide an **ability to use some functional programming technics in Java.**

A typical example is interface `Comparator<T>`:

```java
        accounts.sort(new Comparator<Account>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Account o1, Account o2) {
                return o1.getFirstName().compareTo(o2.getFirstName());
            }
        });
```
It can be easily simplified using lambda expression:
```java
        accounts.sort((a1, a2) -> a1.getFirstName().compareTo(a2.getFirstName()));
```
