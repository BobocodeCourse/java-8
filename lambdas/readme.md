This is the tutorial on lambdas, method reference, and functional interfaces. 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Java is an OOP language, so it always works with classes and **doesn't support standalone functions**. In case you want to **pass some function as a method parameter**, or **store some code into a variable**, you should use a *Functional Interface* and a *Lambda expression*. 

* A *Functional Interface (FI)* represents a **function signature**. It contains only one abstract method.
* A *Lambda expression* represents a **function body**. Is an anonymous function that implements the abstract method of the functional interface

The purpose of the lambda and functional interfaces is to **make it easier to create function objects** and provide an **ability to use some functional programming technics in Java.**

A typical example is interface `Comparator<T>`:

```java
        accounts.sort(new Comparator<Account>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Account o1, Account o2) {
                return o1.getFirstName().compareTo(o2.getFirstName());
            }
        });
```
It can be easily simplified using lambda expression:
```java
        accounts.sort((a1, a2) -> a1.getFirstName().compareTo(a2.getFirstName()));
```
In case you are calling some existing method inside the lambda, you can reference that method instead of acctually calling it. This technique is called *Method Reference*. Combining it with usefull default method `comparing()` it can help you to simplify the code even more:
```java
        accounts.sort(comparing(Account::getFirstName));
```

### Best practices
* use **lambdas instead of anonymous classes**
* **avoid lambda parameter types**, unless it can improve code readability 
* **keep lambda expression small** (1 line is the best option)
* **always use `@FunctionalInterface` annotation** for custom functional interfaces
* **prefer standard predefined functional interfaces** (`java.util.function`)
* create a **custom FI**, in case it has some **specific contract**, and you can **benefit from self-descriptive name** and **default methods**
* **ALWAYS USE SPECIAL FI FOR PRIMITIVES** (e.g. `IntToDoubleFunction` instead of `Function<Integer, Double>`)
* **prefer method reference** in all cases where it helps to improve readability
