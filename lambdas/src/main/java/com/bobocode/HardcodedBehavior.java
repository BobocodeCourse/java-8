/**
 * Parameterization in old Java version.
 *
 * This is a typical example of Java code before version 8. The first class citizens in Java are objects.
 * Therefore we always pass as methods arguments only primitive values, and objects. In other words, we add methods
 * parameters to make methods more universal. But what if we need to parameterize the behavior? What if we need to
 * perform different operations on account list basing on different conditions? That's called behavior parameterization.
 *
 * Behavior parameterization can be achieved by passing some function as methods parameter, but Java does not allow us
 * to pass functions as method parameters. Does it?
 *
 * Let's try to solve this problem with old Java style. We can not pass a function, but we can create an interface
 * with one method, and then pass its anonymous implementation with required logic. That's much more flexible right?
 *
 * See @{@link BehaviorParameterizationWithAnonymousClasses}
